--- abstract

This is a Workshop Report for the IETF Administrative Support Activity
2.0 (IASA 2.0) Virtual Workshops, held on 28 February 2017 at 1100 UT
and 1600 UT. The original IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA,
{{RFC4071}}) was created ten years ago, and since been subject to some
reflection. In the intervening years, there has been considerable
change in the necessary tasks of IETF administration and in the world
around the IETF {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}} and in how the IETF
raises funds and finances its work
{{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.  The IASA 2.0 process seeks to
address what administrative arrangements will best support the IETF
going forward.

Introduction {#intro}
============

In 2016, IETF leadership began a discussion of the need to review and
possibly rework administrative arrangements at the IETF, dubbed the
IETF Administrative Support Activity 2.0 project {{Arkko-2016}}.  A
series of virtual workshops related to this effort were scheduled and
held on 28 February 2017 at 11:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC. (The agenda,
slides, and minutes from the two meetings are available at the
workshop proceedings {{IASA20-proceedings}}. Recordings of the two
workshops are also available {{IASA20-1100UT-rec}}
{{IASA20-1600UT-rec}}.)

For background, the IASA arrangements were created more than ten years
ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own administration
{{RFC4071}}. In the intervening years, there has been considerable
change in the necessary tasks of IETF administration and in the world
around the IETF {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}} and in how the IETF
raises funds and finances its work
{{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.  The IASA 2.0 process seeks to
address what administrative arrangements will best support the IETF
going forward.

To make changes, the IETF community first needed to understand what
challenges or missed opportunities there are in the current system. A
number of areas currently face challenges: structural issues regarding
the roles and interfaces between the IETF, the IAOC, ISOC, the IESG,
and contractors; challenges to the IETF funding model; availability of
staff, contractor, and volunteer resources compared to the
administrative workload; and, internal IAOC organizational issues.

To get input from the community about what problems exist in these
areas (and others) IETF leadership set up two virtual workshops, open
to everyone from the community and people who are or have worked in
IETF-administrative roles. (Readers of this report who are less
familiar with IETF administration are strongly encouraged to read BCP
101 {{RFC4071}} {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}} and
{{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.)

The workshops were virtual meetings where the participants provided
their experiences and suggestions.  The workshops primarily focused on
identifying current challenges and opportunities.  Proposed changes
and solutions will be discussed and dealt with in a later phase of the
IASA 2.0 project.

Terminology and Organizational Structure {#termsorg}
========================================

Terminology {#terms}
-----------

The following acronyms will be heavily used in the discussion below:

* IASA - IETF Administrative Support Activity - An organized activity
  that provides administrative support for the IETF, the IAB and the
  IESG.

* IAOC - IETF Administrative Oversight Committee - A largely
  IETF-selected committee that oversees and directs IASA. Accountable
  to the IETF community.

* IAD - IETF Administrative Director - The sole staff member
  responsible for carrying out the work of the IASA. An ISOC employee.

* IETF Trust - Acquires, maintains, and licenses intellectual and
  other property used in connection with the administration of the
  IETF. Same composition as IAOC.

Organizational Structure {#org}
------------------------

In terms of organizational arrangements, the workshop chairs showed a
slide that provided an organizational diagram of the relationships
between various entities {{IASA-Org-Chart}}.
In addition, the IAOC relies on a number of
subcommittees to get its work done -- Finance, Legal Management,
Meetings, Technology Management, and RFP Committee in addition to any
ad hoc committees -- which were not reflected in the diagram, noted one
participant.

Some workshop participants felt that the diagram generally reflected
reality and that it illustrated the large number of moving pieces
involved. It was pointed out that there are a lot of moving parts
compared to 11 years ago when the IASA was formed, as IASA now "owns"
certain functions that it did not at that time, such as the Secretariat and RPC.


Workshop Goals {#goals}
==============

Slide 6 - Workshop Goals

* Gain fuller understanding of -
    * Challenges and missed opportunities in current IASA
    * What is working well 
    * Likely future needs
* Save solutioneering for a later time.

Gonzo - Here to brainstorm

Leslie - Good to capture the issues; the mailing list is there and we can continue to capture. Today is to grasp some of the larger issues.


Issues Raised {#issues}
=============

The IASA 2.0 Virtual Workshops focused on the following areas, ordered
in terms of decreasing priority given input at the workshops.


Structural Issues {#structure}
-----------------

Slide 10. Structural issues between the IETF, the IAOC, ISOC, the IESG, and contractors

* The line between the IETF and ISOC is not organizationally clear-cut, which has led to issues around transparency, allocation of staff time and priorities, budgeting, and clarity of who is responsible for what.
* The respective roles of ISOC, the IETF chair, the IAOC, and the secretariat in representing the IETF to sponsors and donors and communicating with them are not clear.
* Having ISOC represent the IETF to sponsors and donors -
    * creates confusion about why the IETF does not represent itself,
    * yields questions about why ISOC does not instead increase its IETF support and how donations can be guaranteed to be dedicated to the IETF, and
    * can result in those soliciting sponsorships and donations having a lack of familiarity with IETF work.

Organization, ISOC/IETF: some items (e.g. IETF Journal) are ISOC driven-and funded, and do not belong to the IETF. It is not clear who is doing what on behalf of whom. Focus on what the *IETF* is doing. Ombudsteam was requested by IETF, ISOC Fellows to the IETF (vs policy fellows).

Accounting, ISOC/Control of ISOC: Improvements to accounting have helped, but needs more work. Accounting budget has increased over last 5-6 years to recognize ISOC staff contributions (now closer, but not there yet). "Accuracy* is increasing. Control needs to be aligned with accounting so IETF can decide. We've been working to improve the accounting of the contributions and manpower of ISOC. But who is in the driver's seat? If we don't like a function, can we delete it, or does that require IETF participation? Some things are very clearly IETF topics, and then there are some that fall in between IETF and ISOC, and then there are some that are ISOC. 

Marketing communication, IETF: How IETF is represented to the outside world (donors, media, other orgs and communities), even if those are currently handled by ISOC (or others). Maybe not number 1 priority.

Organization, ISOC/IETF, Marketing communication: People don't understand the difference between ISOC/IETF, need consistent messaging. How to make this clearer/more digestible?

Organization, IETF, legal structure: Benefit to the Internet for the IETF to be ephemeral (have a lack of clarity about structure), and not so focused on structure (e.g. no members). Improving the IASA stuff could make things less appealing to some kinds of contributors. Clarity that institutionalizes that accessibility to all participants (this is tricky). More formality is not necessary, but that's the trend w/in this community. 

Organization, IETF, legal structure: there are practical implications (e.g. legal transactions generally go through ISOC).

Organization, ISOC/IETF: Need to distinguish between outward-facing issues and internal ones. We do ourselves a disservice by this long-standing confusion about whether IETF is an organization. People within the community know what is meant by the IETF. When ISOC is raising funds on behalf of the IETF, it is IETF money and they are a sub-contractor. Being more clear about that would help.

Organization, ISOC/IETF: IETF participants are confused about who has policy authority over some of these aspects. If we want to change the structure of what we do for sponsors, who has the authority to make that decision? IESG? IAOC? Community consensus? There tends to be a gap in terms of the IAOC being the body that carries this out. Do people think it's clear? With some other ISOC activities that have visibility to the outside world, like the IETF Fellows, the IETF Journal, the lunch meetings that are part of ISOC programming. Who defines the content for those? Who decides how to drive those things? Should those should be included in the budget?

Organization, ISOC/IETF: How does the IAOC get its policy instructions from the community? Is that clear enough for us all or not? The IAOC posts policy proposals to the IETF community for comment (e.g. the privacy policy or changed to the trust legal provisions). The IAOC only goes to the community for specific policy questions but does not get general 'please do this' from the community. In many cases the "policy from the IETF community" comes through the IESG as voiced by the IETF chair.  

Organization, ISOC/IETF:  Where should some of the questions be asked (e.g. 'how many logos do we want on our badges?" "who drives/has responsibility for some specific functions". The general question - is it a "thin" IAOC that has mostly oversight of IAD or a "thick" IAOC that has administrative responsibilities - i.e. who is driving the bus?



Funding Issues {#funding}
--------------

Slide 12. Funding issues

* Meeting fees are currently an important source of revenue, but remote participation and other factors may be responsible for declining in-person meeting attendance going forward. Even if fees were charged for remote participation, charging the same for remote and in-person attendance is unlikely to be a viable way to make up the difference.
* While there has been a lot of sponsor support for, e.g., meeting hosting, getting support for the full sponsorship program is not easy. The value to sponsors is not always obvious, the IETF community is sometimes critical or unappreciative, and the same sponsors get tapped again and again for many related but different opportunities.
* Relying heavily on meeting-based revenue is somewhat at odds with the fact that much of the IETF's work takes place outside of in-person meetings.
* The IETF is increasingly relying on professional services to support its activities, causing expenses to grow.

Funding issues are covered in {{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}: Costs are going up (more tools, new hotels, etc.), funding is flat, operating expenses are not covered by meeting fees, so increased pressure on sponsorship, increased ISOC contribution.

Funding, suggestion: Fund meetings through fees and sponsorships, have other sponsorships for other activities. 

Funding, sources: Registration fees prohibitive for many.

Funding, suggestion: IETF endowment

Funding, suggestion: Long-term sponsorship, such as Global Hosts

Funding, from ISOC, current: Posted ISOC 2015 budget - total budget $38M, IETF $9.4M (BALLPARK), but IETF sees less than $3M

Funding, clarity: More needed. 

Funding, relevance: Looking for sponsors is a good way to measure support in the community. If that starts to dry up, it's probably a symptom of larger problems of us being no longer relevant. IETF needs to ensure its ongoing relevance. It would be good for the IETF to understand what it's offering. Anecdote: it's valuable to stay in touch with the engineers who understand how the Internet works. But I don't know how to tie that back to three meetings a year. I suspect this will never line up perfectly, but that doesn't take away the need for clarity.

Funding, sources: It's good for the IETF to multiple sources of funding to stand on. Challenges in this space are covered in {{I-D.arkko-ietf-finance-thoughts}}.

Funding, sources: Mismatch between our activities and our funding model. Diversity is a good thing because it allows you to shift gears. 

Funding, sources: Global hosts. If you think the level of funding we're getting, $500K a year--if you compare it to open-source projects, we could be getting a lot more money. The best way to support the IETF as an organization is to become a Global Host. 

Funding, sources, sponsorship: There is printing T-shirts, social events; have to get the marketing departments involved. I think we could focus on just getting the money, and having someone else worry about the logistic problems. There is extra work involved, but there is a lot of risk as a meeting sponsor if you get anything wrong, and that's expertise IETFers don't have. 

Funding, solicitation, marketing communication: Need to be able to better articulate what the ask is, as well as what the relevance is for the potential sponsor. Who is responsible for the messages, how to do the outreach? It is split between the different parties.

Funding, solicitation by participants: Easier to gain sponsorship for easily communicated, defined activities, like Systers Lunch. IETF participants may be more inclined to seek sponsorship for such things. 

Funding, solicitation by staff: Challenges of trying to outsource some of the responsibilities around funding (participants may do a better job than staffers). 

Funding, sponsor perspective: Global host considers it unusual to be funding IETF through a third party, wonders if the IETF is getting the money right away, wonders if the structure makes sense. Makes it difficult to contribute to the IETF endowment (TODO: How? Ask Livingood for particulars). Maybe some different level of financial and administrative separation would be helpful.

Funding, solicitation: Explaining the need for diversity of funding is more complicated than it needs to be. We need to find a simpler story.

Funding, solicitation: It seems like there are 2 types of organizations we're looking for--involved in the Internet ecosystem, and those interested in standards. Figuring out how to do outreach to both of those would be helpful. The relevancy is critical to the sponsorship and funding aspects.

Funding, solicitation: We go back to the same people for support over and over again. How do we find new companies? What is the right proportion for meeting-based revenue? What are the alternative methods to fund the non-meeting-based activities? Do we hire staff or contract to provide assistance?





Transparency Issues {#transparency}
-------------------

Slide 9. Transparency

* IAOC has typically been perceived to operate less transparently than what is the norm for IETF processes and other IETF leadership bodies.
* Lack of transparency has some roots in concerns about confidentiality of contract terms and business relationships, and fear of community reaction to administrative decisions.
* Requirements from the community about IAOC transparency expectations are not clear.

Communication, IAOC, IASA to IETF: IASA has lagged progress of groups like IESG. it would be good to recognize it in agenda/meeting. Community (IETF) should document the transparency requirement clearly, e.g.  set the default to be open, such as open meetings, and publish exception list. Fear is a significant cause of lack of transparency. Need to move to doing the right thing and moving forward.

Communication, IAOC to IETF: The IAOC could do better in telling the community what it does and how it makes decisions. Now that we're limiting time in the plenary, the community doesn't get to see the IAOC very much so they don't see them or understand what they do.

Communication, IAOC to IETF: How much do people know about the subcommittees? The transparency of what we tell the community is evolving a bit. Devil is in the details - what the contracts are and getting clarity on what is going on with that. Hotel contracts aren't shown, and there have been some arguments about that. Understanding what we need to improve and where we can improve.

Communication, IAOC to IETF: IAOC plenary presentations - people don't want over-exposure to the boring details. They're boring until they're not and everyone is surprised. I'm not sure that time in plenary is the way to get people to know what the IAOC does. How to encourage more of the IETF community to understand the IAOC and role of the IASA?

Communication, IAOC to IETF: Info sessions, etc. Help getting to know and have people put their names forward. 

Communication, IAOC to IETF:  Provide insight into what the IAOC is going to do, as opposed to what it has just done. Telegraphing for a few years may improve the level of education. I think that would help those transparency requirements without running afoul of the contracts. A Last Call for some IAOC things is worthy. But other things simply don't permit it. Having the IAOC document the basis for a decision, rather than the mere fact of it. For the mundane stuff, that's too much work, but for other things that might help the community.

Communication: IAOC to IETF: 2 potential sources of fear - making a decision you know the community won't like, and having a situation where there is a Last Call and all of the previous conversations the IAOC has had are rehashed. 

Communication: IAOC to IETF: The ADs for most areas hold office hours at some point during meeting weeks, to allow people to corner us and raise concerns, and ask for guidance. Does the IAOC do anything like that during meeting weeks? 


Staff and Volunteer Resource Issues {#staff}
-----------------------------------

Slide 8. Staff and volunteer resource issues

* IAD workload is (much) more than a full-time job, but we have one staff person allocated to it.
* IASA tasks touch on a wider variety of topics and require more different kinds of expertise than 10 years ago (visa issues, local social/political/health issues, new modes of fundraising, etc.), but the job descriptions and skill sets of staff and volunteers do 
not always match these needs.
* Very few community members have the time, support, and interest to stand for the IAOC (or even participate in administrative discussions, unless something goes astray), and many who do are self-funding their work.

Organization, IAOC: Do we conduct exit interviews? No since no IAD has exited. 

Organization, IAOC/Contractors: Need to understand requirements/dependencies on contractors and other support structure to really understand how things work - it is complicated and not generally well understood

Organization, IAOC/Volunteers: Draw a sharper distinction between volunteering for IAOC and for things like tools, as shows on structural slide earlier.

Organization, IAOC/Subcommittees: Not clear who is involved/serving on IAOC subcommittees, not sure what effort is required/expended. Lack of encouragement of/participation in subcommittees might be a disincentive for IAOC participation

Organization, IAOC/Subcommittees: A point of having subcommittees is to draw in expertise in a particular area, without burdening them with the overall task of IAOC responsibility. Elaborating what kind of expertise is needed can be a challenge. There is a general challenge in elaborating what skills are needed for any of the areas of work here.

Organization, IAOC/Subcommittees: The function of the committees seems to go pretty well, sometimes scope and authority in relation to the IAOC are unclear. What kind of decision is being made? A committee can make a recommendation that is subject to easy reversal by the IAOC, which can provide an undercurrent of doubt when discussions take place.

Organization, IAOC/Subcommittees: Surprised to see how many people are involved in subcommittees. The composition of volunteers/staff may cause confusion about role, and control/accountability issues. Who's really in charge? who is leading the discussions/making decisions, who is supporting those decisions. Lack of documentation/explanation about how the committees are chosen

Organization, IAOC/Subcommittees: For some teams (e.g., meetings, legal) it is necessary to have staff (e.g., ietf lawyer, site visit and meeting contract negotiation staff). Lists of subcommittees are here - https://iaoc.ietf.org/committees.html. On legal committee - the base membership comes from the IAOC plus the lawyer to then last year we asked for volunteers from the community and added the one persons who stepped up


Internal IAOC Organizational Issues {#IAOCorg}
-----------------------------------

Slide 11. Internal IAOC organizational issues

* The IAOC has 4 ex officio members (IETF Chair, IAB Chair, ISOC CEO, IAD (non-voting)), and 5 appointed members. One of 5 members is appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees, and is traditionally expected not to stand for IAOC Chair. This yields -
    * A small pool from which to select the IAOC Chair
    * A small pool from which to select the IETF Trust Chair
    * Very few (2, by the time you've appointed Chairs) "worker bees" for the IAOC
* Requiring that the IAOC and the IETF Trust be constituted by the same group of people overloads the job responsibilities of both roles, narrows the pool of individuals willing and able to serve on the IAOC, and creates the potential for conflicts in cases where the creation of Trust policies requires IAOC oversight.
* Requiring that the IAB chair serve on the IAOC overloads the IAB Chair's job responsibilities and narrows the pool of people willing and able to serve as IAB Chair. The same may be true for the IETF Chair.

IAOC, membership: I've heard stories of NomCom not knowing what they're looking for.

IAOC, membership: Does communication translate into more people wanting to participate in the IAOC? Is that framed properly? Make sure the information is available in email and on the website, but that's not going to inspire people who don't care about administrative issues to volunteer. Expecting to rely on volunteers for this large volume of work is unreasonable. If people can spend time on the technical work, that would be a success. There are multiple different sources, and we can change the expectations.

Three issues: 1/ community knowing more 2/ ability to affect things (e.g., know stuff early enough that you can have an effect in a decision) 3/ this translating to bigger willingness to participate in IAOC input/work/etc. It "may be unreasonable to rely on volunteers"."

Organization, IAOC membership: There is a tradition of not having board of trustee not stand for chair. Tradition not requirement. Can move away from it. 

Organization, IAOC membership: Difficult to fill so many leadership positions. 

Organization, IAOC/IAD: To what extent is IAOC an oversight body (this might be managed as a workload issue)

Organization, IETF/IAOC, communication: How does the IAOC get the policy instructions from the community? Who actually decides? Not clear. An issue that's been a sore point, has been debated.

Organization, IAOC membership: If we want to look at changing the makeup of the IAOC, we need to have a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities. Apart from scoping the IAOC well, we need to revisit how we populate the IAOC if we want it to be able to do more than the very thinnest of oversight roles.

Organization, IAOC membership: Populating the IAOC is difficult because so few of the appointees can be Chair, only the appointees from the IESG, IAB, and 2 NomCom. One of those 4 people will always be the Chair, and another of those 4 will chair the Trust. Need a way for the community to pick additional people. It's important that the appointers choose people who have interest in chairing, otherwise the pool gets smaller.

Organization, IAOC membership: The ex officios need to be participants, for the extreme context they carry with them. But they just don't have the time, and the way to solve that is to increase the regular membership of the IAOC. 

Organization, IAOC: Trust and rest of IAOC tasks are separate talents

Organization, IAOC/Trust: Maybe it is no longer convenient that the IAOC and Trust are together, given the IANA stewardship transition issues last year. Secondary issue to more fundamental questions like the structure and funding.

Organization, Trust: Does the Trust need to be as large as it currently is? Could it be smaller? would it be good for it to be smaller?

Organization, Trust: Size not an issue (aside from getting quorum once or twice)

Organization, Trust: Responsibilities of trust are evolving...but it could be changed. Composition is also an issue that might be discussed

Organization, Trust: Size+composition should be determined by role of the Trust, which should be part of the IASA 2.0 discussions
- currently, the trust does not do all that much so having separate people would have a bunch of people with not much to do
